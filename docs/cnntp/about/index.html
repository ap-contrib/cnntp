  Lots of bugs fixed

2002/02/01
  If you go to a too high article number you get redirected to the
  latest articles instead of getting a 404.

2002/01/30
  Quoted text now comes in a slight gray greenish color. Different anyway.

  When finding a message by msgid the Next and Previous buttons now
  still works. (requires support of the xpath command in the news
  server; I have a patch for colobus that adds that).

  Email addresses from the headers are being slightly mangled now.
