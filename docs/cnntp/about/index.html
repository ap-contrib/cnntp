<h1>About this site</h1>

<p> 

nntp.perl.org was created by <a href="http://askask.com/">Ask
Bj&oslash;rn Hansen</a>.

</p>

<p> The site is built with
<a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a>,
<a href="http://perl.apache.org/">mod_perl</a>, 
<a href="http://combust.develooper.com/">Combust</a>,
<a href="http://trainedmonkey.com/colobus/">colobus</a> and
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=libnet">Net::NNTP</a>.

</p>

<p>
A bit of Perl code is using Net::NNTP to connect to the colobus
server which uses the perl.org ezmlm archives as the "news spool".
</p>

<p>
The code is available from Subversion at <a href="https://svn.develooper.com/projects/cnntp/">https://svn.develooper.com/projects/cnntp/</a>.

Updates:

2006 October
  All new code! :-)

  Proper threading and navigation - finally!

  Lots of bugs fixed

2002/02/01
  If you go to a too high article number you get redirected to the
  latest articles instead of getting a 404.

2002/01/30
  Quoted text now comes in a slight gray greenish color. Different anyway.

  When finding a message by msgid the Next and Previous buttons now
  still works. (requires support of the xpath command in the news
  server; I have a patch for colobus that adds that).

  Email addresses from the headers are being slightly mangled now.
